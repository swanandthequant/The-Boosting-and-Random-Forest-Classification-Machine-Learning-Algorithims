## datasets
I Downloaded it online

## Methodolody
1.Data Cleaning
2.Feature Engineering
3.Model Training
4.Model Evaluation (using accuracy_score, classification_report,ConfusionMatrixDisplay,precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score,roc_curve )
5.Hyper Parameter Tuning (Using Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV)
6.Model Evaluation (accuracy_score, classification_report,ConfusionMatrixDisplay,precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score,roc_curve)

## what I learned
I learned about How the Random forest(classification) and boosting (classification)Techniques are used for model Training and its prediction

## Project Updates
This was the classifier one and now my focus would be going to change finance thing and how do we use python for finance
Thank you everyone
