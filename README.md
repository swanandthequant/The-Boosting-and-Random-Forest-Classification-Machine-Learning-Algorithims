## Project Overview

This project applies Logistic Regression to a dataset for binary classification. The main goal was to understand how Logistic Regression can be used for predicting categorical outcomes and to evaluate its performance against standard metrics.

## Dataset

A structured dataset containing both numerical and categorical features.

Target variable: binary classification (0/1).


## Methodology

1. Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).


2. Split data into training and testing sets.


3. Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.


4. Evaluated performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC Curve and AUC



5. Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature importance.



## Results

Logistic Regression provided solid baseline performance for classification.

Metrics like precision and recall highlighted trade-offs depending on class imbalance.

ROC curve gave additional insights into model sensitivity.


## What I Learned

How Logistic Regression works as a linear classifier for probabilities.

How to interpret coefficients in terms of odds ratio.

How to use classification metrics beyond accuracy.


## Future Work

Try Regularized Logistic Regression (L1, L2 penalties).

Compare with tree-based classification models for better performance
