# Classification with Travel Dataset  

This project applies different **classification algorithms** on a travel related dataset.  
The goal was to predict categories from travel features and see which model works the best.  

---

## Dataset  
- Dataset used: Travel dataset (contains both numerical and categorical features).  
- Preprocessing was required for missing values and encoding of categorical vars.  

---

## Methodology  
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Feature Encoding and Scalling  
3. Model Training with Logistic Regression and other classifiers  
4. Model Evaluation using:  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - ROC Curve and ROC AUC  
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV)  
6. Compared different models for best performence

## What I Learned  
- How to apply regression style thinking into classification tasks.  
- Importance of feature engineering in categorical datasets like Travel data.  
- The trade-offs between precision and recall depending on the classes.  

---

## Project Updates  
- Still improving the results with other algorithms like Random Forest and Boosting.  
- Will share updated notebooks once finished, so stay tunned.  

Thank you all for checking it out.
